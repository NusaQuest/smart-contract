# NusaQuest : Beaches aren't gonna clean themselves. 🚀

## ✨ Overview

🌏 NusaQuest is an impact-to-earn platform powered by AI 🤖 and DAO 🧠, built on the Lisk Sepolia network 🛰️, that turns real-world environmental actions into meaningful digital rewards. Through beach cleanups across Indonesia 🇮🇩, anyone can earn NUSA tokens 💰 and redeem them for NFT concert tickets 🎫. With KYC verification via OCR of KTP 🪪🔍, NusaQuest ensures trusted participation while bridging Web3 🌐 with real-world impact 🌱. It makes caring for the environment fun and rewarding — while empowering communities through transparent, decentralized systems and meaningful incentives.
